# Welcome!

Since 2003, [Prakash Panagaden](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/) has organised yearly workshops at the [McGill Bellairs Research Center](https://www.mcgill.ca/bellairs/), on a range of topics including quantum information, probabilistic systems, duality theory, learning, and verification. This webpage gathers the information of all the workshops, including participant list and topics. It is meant as a reminder of the many fantastic weeks spent in an idylic  location enjoying wonderful and inspiring talks and discussions.  

Typically, two workshops, of about 15 participants each, run in paralell and interactions are fomented through shared keynote lectures and social events, including all meals.
